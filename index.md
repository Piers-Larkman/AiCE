# AiCE Project Summary
We are missing a central piece in the puzzle to understanding our Earth’s climate: Its dynamics fundamentally changed during the “Mid-Pleistocene Transition”, when some 1.2 million years ago the oscillation between warm periods and ice ages shifted its periodicity from 41 to 100 ka. A key set of information about this change was archived in the snow that fell at that time in Antarctica. At unique locations, that snow is still preserved today in the deepest ice layers– but does it still contain its original message?
